                <h3 class="faq-title">How many portions are your meal?</h3>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    All of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average
                    adult. Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners
                    (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at just about
                    13 ounces, which is about 10% larger than similar competitors.
                    What’s even better: our meals average just 500 calories and range
                    from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do
                    offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for a family of
                    4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple
                    subscriptions.

                <p class="faq-text">
                    We accommodate a variety of dietary preferences, and always offer an
                    entirely gluten– and peanut–free menu. As a customer, you can set
                    your own dietary preferences and easily find the meals that work for
                    you. You can also check out individual ingredient lists for each
                    dish if you have specific concerns, or contact us at
                    support@freshly.com for help making selections. If you’re unable to
                    place an order that fits your preferences now, be sure to check back
                    frequently as we’re always adding new and exciting dishes.

                <p class="faq-text">
                    You won't find any artificial or chemical preservatives here so all
                    of our freshly-prepared meals have a refrigerated shelf life of
                    about 4-5 days. You can find a "use by" date on the back of each
                    meal on the nutrition label. If you're ever unable to finish your
                    meals within their shelf life, you can always pop them into the
                    freezer for extended storage. Just be sure to microwave your meal
                    straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the
                    165° F internal temperature we recommend.

                <h3 class="faq-title">How do I heat up my meals?</h3>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat
                    ‘em up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, you’ll find our
                    easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3
                    minutes (depending on your microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2
                    minutes and heat in 30–second increments until the meal reaches an
                    inner temperature of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in
                    the microwave (for the ultimate convenience), but you can heat them
                    in the oven if you’d like. Just so you know, our current meal
                    containers aren’t safe for the oven or stovetop, so you’ll have to
                    transfer your food to heat it up. You can check out the full oven
                    reheat directions in our FAQ.

                <h3 class="faq-title">How does shipping work?</h3>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    To help guarantee your meals arrive in the freshest condition, there
                    is a small shipping fee associated with your order. We deliver to
                    all states within the continental U.S., and our shipping partners
                    offer delivery every day of the week. The exact days that we can
                    reach you will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier delivering
                    your Freshly meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your
                    typical delivery day, we'll show you all the days available to you
                    so you can choose what's best for you.
